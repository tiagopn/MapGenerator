# MapGenerator

This scrypt is intended to be used by Python or C++ Mobile Ground Robot programmers to generate a map from a file (either a plant building image file or a self made image file).


Many thanks to Cara Sperback that helped our Robotics Group with this script.
I changed a little bit the last par of the code to be more user friendly.
Plus, now it is part of the Turtlebot package in ROS Melodic :)
